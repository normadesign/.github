Norma is a Turin-based graphic design studio that explores the nihilistic possibility of removing aesthetic choice from the transmission of information. Norma does absolutely nothing special.

## Graphic and web design
Since 2018 Norma has been experimenting with radical ideas through [graphic design](https://normadesign.it/en/graphic-design-torino/), [web development](https://normadesign.it/en/web-development-torino/), [editorial design](https://normadesign.it/en/books-editorial-design/) and [corporate branding](https://normadesign.it/en/brand-identity-design/), in the belief that a quickly printed sheet of A4 paper with Times New Roman lettering is better and more effective communication than any decoration or mystification.

## Activities, events
Norma completed various non-commercial projects, including experimenting with [dithering filters](https://normadesign.it/en/dithering-instagram-filter/) and augmented reality, curating an archive of [Yamaha instruments](https://yamahablackboxes.com/) and collaborating to the realization of [torinodesign.info](https://torinodesign.info/), a directory of designers from Turin.
